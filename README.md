## GET STARTED - PREPARE THE DOUGH

_Time: 10 minutes or less, if you have gathered and identified all ingredients, tools n things above._

1. Obtain **12 oz water**. Warm up **12 oz water** (warm from the tap is fine).
2. Put that **12 oz water** in the **mixing bowl**.
3. Add **2 teaspoon yeast** to **mixing bowl**.
4. OPTIONAL: Put in the **pinch of sugar** to kick-start the yeast & cut the yeasty flavor.
5. Stir around contents of **mixing bowl** with a **spoon**.
6. Add **2 teaspoon salt** to the **mixing bowl**.
7. Measure out or weigh **3 cup flour(450g)**.
8. Add **3 cup flour(450g)** to the **mixing bowl**.
9. Combine contents of **mixing bowl** with a **spoon**. You may need to use a "folding" method. [Watch a quick video on how to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7To3giV62rg).
10. Moving forward, this combination will be called **DOUGH**.
11. Now that the **dough** has been created, you have two choices depending on your **patience** level.  See `Option 1: I want it sooner` or `Option 2: I want it later`.



## OPTION 1: I WANT IT SOONER

1. You will still need some **patience** for this, as it may take about two hours.
2. Cover the **mixing bowl** with the **dough** with a **cloth (like a tea towel)**.  This should be draped over the **mixing bowl** and NOT tight nor touching the **dough**.
3. Place the **mixing bowl** in a room that is "room temperature". 70째+F or 21째+C should work.  Proofing **dough** will differ based on the temperature and humidity of your room.
4. Use your **patience** and wait about two hours.  Regularly check on the **dough** to see how much it has risen.
5. Once the **dough** has risen to about 2x, you are ready to move forward to `Bake the Bread`.


## OPTION 2: I WANT IT LATER

1. This method will also need some **patience**, but you can relax at least.
2. Cover the **mixing bowl** with the **dough** with **plastic//beeswax wrap**.  This should cover the **mixing bowl** and NOT tight nor touching the **dough**.
3. Place the covered **mixing bowl** with the **dough** in your **cold location (refrigerator)**.
4. Use your **patience** to wait at least 1 day. Regularly check on the **dough** to see how much it has risen.
5. You may wait up to three days.  Chemistry will change the flavors of the **dough** the longer that this is proofed, so be aware.
6. Once the **dough** has risen to about 2x, and you are ready to bake, move forward to `Bake the Bread`.


## BAKE THE BREAD

1. Preheat your oven to 450째F (230째C).
2. Put your **dutch oven** in the **oven** to preheat that as well.
3. Get **parchement paper** ready.
4. Place **dough** on **parchement paper** and shape it to be a sphere/loaf that would ideally fit your **dutch oven**.
5. Use **knife** to score an X on the top of the **dough**.
6. Take **dutch oven** out of the **oven**. Remove the lid. THIS IS HOT! USE PROTECTION!
7. Put **parchement paper** with **dough** on top into the **dutch oven**. THIS IS HOT! USE PROTECTION!
8. Put lid on the **dutch oven** and put it in the **oven**. THIS IS HOT! USE PROTECTION!
9. Using your **patience**, bake for _30 minutes_.
10. Take the lid off of the **dutch oven**.  THIS IS HOT! USE PROTECTION!
11. Using your **patience**, bake for another _20 minutes_.
12. Take the **dutch oven** out of the **oven**. THIS IS HOT! USE PROTECTION!
13. Turn off the **oven**.
14. Your **dough** is now **bread**.
15. Let the **bread** rest for at least _15 minutes_ while it cools.  Take note that the **bread** is still technically cooking until it has cooled off, and you do not want to disturb it.
16. You may now move forward to `Enjoy the Bread`.


## ENJOY THE BREAD

1. Now that the **bread** has cooled, you may enjoy your bread.
2. For best results, slice using a combination of your **patience** and a **bread knife**.
